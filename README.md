## Inspiration

Ever since pandemic has started everything have been switched to virtual mode including health care. There are still many people now who have phobia in visiting hospitals due to rapidly spreading virus. The consultance that a person can get in an online platform is nothing less, in fact much better than visiting hospitals. With this inspiration we tried to come up with one stop destination for an ultimate health care assistance.
